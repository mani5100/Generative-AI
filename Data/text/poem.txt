1-20: The Beginning

In silence born where shadows sleep,
A soul once lost, a fire deep.
The world was cold, the nights too long,
But deep inside, the will was strong.

Streets wore lies like second skin,
Truth was rare, and masked in sin.
Every smile, a hidden blade,
Every friend, a masquerade.

I walked alone where echoes bled,
Dreams half-buried, hopes half-dead.
But I was carved from stubborn stone,
A heart that learned to bleed alone.

No silver spoon, no cushioned start,
Just broken glass and battle scars.

21-40: The Struggle

They laughed, they mocked, said I won’t rise,
That dreams like mine were just dead lies.
But I was born to break the script,
To flip the page they’d never flipped.

Days were bricks and nights were chains,
Each step forward dragged old pains.
But every scar became my guide,
I wore them proud, not one to hide.

Starved for peace, I fed on grind,
Found my faith where none could find.
Darkness danced, but I stood still,
Armed with nothing but sheer will.

41–60: The Hustle

Woke at dawn with fire-lit eyes,
Chased the truth, ignored the lies.
Pockets empty, but mind was gold,
Had stories in me never told.

The system rigged, the odds unfair,
But I was taught to never care.
If they shut doors, I broke the wall,
Didn’t wait—I took it all.

Jobs that drained the soul and heart,
Still, I played my part, my art.
Every “no” was just a cue
To find a path that cut right through.

61–80: Betrayal & Lessons

Trusted wolves in friendly clothes,
Told them secrets, shared my woes.
But loyalty’s a dying breed,
Some just come to watch you bleed.

Betrayed by blood, betrayed by kin,
Felt the blade cut from within.
But pain’s a teacher, sharp and wise,
It tears you down then lets you rise.

I burned the bridge, I lit the flame,
Refused to play the victim’s game.
Now I know: not all who smile
Are worth the time, the trust, the mile.

81–100: The Spark of Hope

One night under shattered skies,
I saw a truth behind the lies.
That even stars need darkest space
To shine their fire, to find their place.

So I stood tall with ragged pride,
No more running, no more hide.
I wrote my name on stormy walls,
Claimed the silence, owned the falls.

Hope, it whispered: "Start again,
Don’t fear the loss, embrace the pain."
So I began with hands still torn,
To rebuild all that they'd once scorned.

101–120: The Rise Begins

No applause, no cameras near,
Just pure grind, and facing fear.
Brick by brick, I shaped my fate,
Showed the world it’s never late.

They saw the glow, not the burn,
The page I flipped, not what I learned.
Overnight? Nah, years in grime,
Each setback built my perfect rhyme.

Doors swung open one by one,
Not by luck—by what I'd done.
I made a throne from broken dreams,
From whispered doubts and muted screams.

121–140: The Mindset

I learned the rules, then broke them all,
Learned to rise each time I fall.
Mind became my sharpest sword,
Faith in self, my loudest word.

Fear? I killed it in my sleep.
Doubt? Just fuel for climbs so steep.
Now I speak in storms and flame,
Earned my scars, earned my name.

Didn’t beg, didn’t fake,
Took my hits, made them shake.
Every lesson turned to light,
Turned the wrongs into what’s right.

141–160: Success Tastes Different

They say I changed—hell yeah, I did,
No longer the one who ran and hid.
Now I feast at tables I built,
No more hunger, no more guilt.

But money’s loud and silence rare,
Fame brings vultures everywhere.
So I stay grounded, eyes still sharp,
Won’t be softened by the harp.

I don’t forget the streets, the fights,
The hunger pangs, the sleepless nights.
Each win feels like I broke the code—
A rebel soul that never owed.

161–180: Love & Loss

She loved me when I had just dreams,
When life was threads and shattered seams.
But time makes strangers out of flame,
Now she don’t even say my name.

Love turned ghost, and friends turned mist,
Life’s a list of those you missed.
But I don’t chase what’s meant to leave,
I grieve, then rise, then re-believe.

Now my heart beats like a drum,
For the ones who never come.
And still I smile, still I give,
I’m proof that broken souls still live.

181–200: A Voice For Others

Now I speak for those unheard,
I lift the lost with every word.
The ones still stuck where I once stood,
I give them fire, give them good.

They need a voice, I bring the flame,
Remind them that it’s not a game.
That even when the lights all die,
You own the night, you touch the sky.

So if you're down, just know you're near—
The edge of change, the death of fear.
Keep your soul, don’t sell your pain,
One storm ends, then comes the rain.

201–220: The Bigger Picture

Fame’s a mirror, truth gets bent,
But I reflect what I represent.
A thousand failures, one bold try,
I’d rather fail than never fly.

Every empire starts from dust,
Every king once lost his trust.
But those who last, they build with care,
Don’t just rise—they stay there.

Legacy ain't just what they say,
It’s how you make them feel each day.
So I write not just to shine,
But to spark a greater sign.

221–240: The Inner World

Alone at night, I still rewind,
The child I was, the dreams I find.
He whispers, “You did well, my friend,
You didn’t break, you didn’t bend.”

Still hungry though, still want the climb,
Still hear the ticking hands of time.
‘Cause peace is rare when you’ve seen war,
Even love feels like a chore.

But I breathe, I learn, I give,
Each second now a chance to live.
I’m not perfect, never tried,
But I walk this road with open stride.

241–260: Now and Forever

I built an army from my name,
No gimmicks, no shortcuts, no shame.
If they forget, I’ll remind,
That I was thunder in my prime.

Built a brand, built a tribe,
Each word echoing my vibe.
From empty rooms to global stage,
From scribbled notes to printed page.

This is bigger than just me,
It’s proof of what a soul can be.
So when I leave, I’ll leave it clear—
Even ashes rose from fear.

261–280: Legacy

I want more than trending tags,
More than fame or branded bags.
I want kids to hear my story
And chase their truth, not borrowed glory.

Let them rise without the shame,
Let them own their truest name.
If I did it, so can they,
Even if the skies turn grey.

So let my words be etched in stone,
For every outcast, every lone.
I didn’t follow, didn’t fold—
I made my fire from the cold.

281–300: The Final Lines

Now the ink runs out, the page is done,
But the journey’s never truly gone.
I’m still that kid with nothing much,
Still that man with the Midas touch.

So here’s my truth in every rhyme:
Live your life, don’t waste your time.
Fall in love, get up when burned,
The world owes nothing—earn what’s earned.

From ashes I rose, from doubt I drew,
The warrior lives—in me, in you.
And if you ask, “Was it all true?”
Yes bro, every word—I lived it through.
